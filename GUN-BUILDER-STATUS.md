# Gun Builder Development Status

## Current Phase

Stage 1 completed. Ready for Stage 2.

## Current Branch

`gun-builder`

## Completed

- Development requirements confirmed.
- Existing Part Selector analyzed and documented (comprehensive architectural audit).
- Git baseline confirmed clean on `gun-builder`.
- **Stage 1 Complete: Safe Plugin Foundation & Legacy Isolation**
  - Refactored `part-selector.php` into modular OOP loader.
  - Isolated legacy `index.html`, Fabric.js v1, Bootstrap 2, and external HTTP jQuery.
  - Created `includes/class-tgb-core.php`, `class-tgb-assets.php`, `class-tgb-shortcode.php`, `class-tgb-product-integration.php`.
  - Built clean semantic shell in `templates/gun-builder.php` scoped to `#taktik-gun-builder`.
  - Built scoped modern CSS foundation in `assets/css/gun-builder.css`.
  - Built lightweight JS initialization foundation in `assets/js/gun-builder.js`.
  - Maintained backward compatibility for shortcode `[part_selector]`.

## Current Task

Review Stage 1 foundation and prepare for Stage 2.

## Next Step

Stage 2: Admin Product Configuration & Part Types (Builder-Ready toggle, physical reference measurements, dynamic categories).
